## The Story: Building a Team is Hard

### The Old Way

Want to build an industrial-strength system? You need:

| Role | What They Do |
|------|--------------|
| **Product Manager** | Vision, strategy, prioritization |
| **Business Analyst** | Requirements, feasibility |
| **UI/UX Designer** | Look and feel, user experience |
| **Architect** | System design, tech choices |
| **Engineer** | Write the code |
| **Code Reviewer** | Quality, best practices |
| **Security Analyst** | Vulnerabilities, compliance |
| **Tester** | Tests, validation |
| **Technical Writer** | Documentation |
| **Release Manager** | Versioning, deployment |
| **Cost Estimator** | Infrastructure, timeline, ROI |

### The Problem

Finding these people is **super hard**:
- Recruiting takes months
- Training takes years
- Salaries are expensive
- Turnover is high
- Coordination is a nightmare

### The Silly Way

Going to an AI and saying:
> "Build me a system"

That's like saying "surprise me" at a restaurant. You might get something great. You might get garbage. Unpredictable. Unreliable.

## The AIDE X Way

**What if you could have an entire team of specialists?**

Each one an AI agent — purpose-built for their role. Working together. Predictable. Controllable.

**No need to:**
- Post job listings
- Conduct interviews
- Negotiate salaries
- Manage HR
- Learn software engineering

**You just:**
1. Define what you want
2. Review what AI proposes
3. Approve what matters
4. Ship

## ⭐ NEW: The Cost Estimator (Plutus)

### Every System Needs to Know: What's the Cost?

The **Plutus** agent calculates:

### 1. Infrastructure Costs
- Cloud hosting (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Database costs
- CDN/bandwidth
- Third-party services

### 2. Development Costs
- Estimated build time
- Agent compute costs
- Human review time

### 3. Maintenance Costs
- Ongoing hosting
- Support overhead
- Update frequency

### 4. ROI Projection
- Time to first release
- Comparison to traditional dev
- Cost savings

### Example Estimate
```
💰 Project Cost Estimate: E-Commerce Platform

Infrastructure (Monthly):
  • Hosting: $150/mo
  • Database: $80/mo
  • CDN: $50/mo
  • Third-party: $100/mo
  ─────────────────────
  Total: $380/mo

Development:
  • AI Build Time: ~4 hours
  • Human Review: ~1 hour
  • First Ship: ~2 days

ROI vs Traditional:
  • Traditional: 3 months, $50K
  • AIDE X: 2 days, $500
  • Savings: 98%

## The Pipeline

```
IDEA → RESEARCH → REQUIREMENTS → UI/UX → ARCHITECTURE 
    → CODE → REVIEW → SECURITY → TESTS → DOCS 
    → COST ESTIMATE → RELEASE → DEPLOYMENT
    
Human approval at EVERY gate
```

## Why AIDE X Wins

| Traditional | AIDE X |
|------------|--------|
| Hire 10+ specialists | 13 AI agents |
| 3-6 months to ship | 2 days to ship |
| $50K+ in dev costs | <$1K in compute |
| Unpredictable quality | Guaranteed standards |
| Need to know coding | Just describe what you want |
