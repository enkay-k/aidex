# AIDE X Development Log

## Session: February 15, 2026

### Summary
Building AIDE X (AI Driven Engineering X) - an agentic operating system where AI agents work like a human engineering team to build production software from vision to release.

---

### Timeline

| Time (EST) | Activity |
|------------|----------|
| ~8:00 PM | Started session - discussed versioning system (YYYY.MM.DD.NNNN format) with Dev Mode toggle |
| ~8:10 PM | Added Chronicler agent (Itihas) for release documentation - built into every project |
| ~8:20 PM | Discussed story: building a team is hard (10+ roles), "surprise me" AI is silly |
| ~8:25 PM | Added Cost Estimator agent (Plutus) - asked if needed |
| ~8:30 PM | Updated website (index.html) and dashboard with new story + 13 agents |
| ~8:40 PM | Refined Cost Estimator to have 2 types: 1) Development cost (AI compute vs human) 2) Operations cost (with free tier options like Vercel, Supabase, Cloudflare) |
| ~8:50 PM | Added Performance Engineer (Titan) and Marketing (Hermes²) agents - emphasized AIDE X is for scale systems (payments, DeFi, agentic engines) not small apps |
| ~9:00 PM | Added DevOps (Karma) and VaPT (Themis) agents |
| ~9:10 PM | User requested Sanskrit codenames when >3 syllables - changed: Hephaestus→Hephaestus (kept), Historiograph→Itihas, Titan→Tosh, Hermes²→Kriti |
| ~9:15 PM | Synced website and whitepaper - both now have 17 agents with consistent codenames |
| ~9:20 PM | User said "thanks" - asked to summarize and pause |

### Key Features Added

1. **Versioning System**
   - Format: YYYY.MM.DD.NNNN (e.g., 2026.02.15.0001)
   - Dev Mode toggle in UI header
   - Release notes panel when Dev Mode ON

2. **Dual Cost Estimation**
   - Development cost (AI compute + human review)
   - Operations cost (with free tier recommendations)

3. **Scale Story**
   - Not for small apps - payment systems, DeFi, agentic engines
   - Large databases, blockchain, AI agents, high traffic

4. **Built-In Standards**
   - User Management, Logging, Alerting, Security
   - Release Management (Itihas), Cost Estimation (Plutus)
   - DevOps (Karma), VaPT (Themis), Performance (Tosh), Marketing (Kriti)

### Files Updated
- `aidex/docs/index.html` - Website with agent grid
- `aidex/docs/dashboard.html` - Control center dashboard
- `aidex/docs/whitepaper.md` - v0.9 with full story
