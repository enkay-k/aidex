# AIDE X - AI Driven Engineering X

**X = Force Multiplier**

AIDE X is an agentic operating system where multiple AI agents work like a human engineering team — each agent has a role, produces observable output, and passes work to the next. Humans watch, guide, and approve — AI does the heavy lifting.

## Vision

Can AI build industrial-strength solutions almost autonomously?

## Pipeline

```
User Pain → Problem Statement → Business Reqs → Features
    ↓
    ├─ Architecture (Blueprint)
    ├─ UI/UX Design (Muse)
    ├─ Code (Forge)
    ├─ Tests (Prover)
    ├─ Docs (DocSmith)
    └─ Deployment (Foreman)
    
Human Decision Gates at Every Major Stage
```
